# Design System Context

## Brand Guidelines
This APM package contains the official design system and accessibility standards for all user-facing applications and interfaces.

## Core Principles
- **Accessibility First**: Every design decision must consider users with disabilities
- **Consistency**: Maintain uniform patterns across all interfaces
- **Performance**: Design with performance implications in mind
- **Mobile Priority**: Design for mobile experiences first, then scale up

## Design Tokens
The design system uses a token-based approach for:
- Color palettes and semantic color assignments
- Typography scales and font selections  
- Spacing and layout dimensions
- Border radius and shadow definitions
- Animation timing and easing functions

## Quality Standards

- WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility compliance
- Cross-browser compatibility testing
- Mobile responsiveness validation
- Performance impact assessment
- Brand consistency review

## Review Process
1. Design review with UX team
2. Accessibility audit completion
